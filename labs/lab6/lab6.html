  Exercise 1:
  Define a filter function on the String object. The function accepts an array of strings that
  specifies a list of banned words. The function returns the string after removing all the
  banned words.
  Example:
  console.log("This house is not nice!".filter('not'));
  Output: "This house is nice!"

  Exercise 2:
  Write a BubbleSort algorithm on the Array object. Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm
  that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted,
  Example:[6,4,0, 3,-2,1].bubbleSort();
  Output : [-2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 6]

  Exercise 3:
  Create an object called Teacher derived from a Person function constructor, and implement
  a method called teach that receives a string called subject, and prints out: [teacher's name]
  is now teaching [subject]. Create a Teacher object and call its teach method.
  Also do the same thing using Object.create. When using Object.create you will need a
  factory function instead of a function constructor in order to pass parameters such as
  ‘name’ to be set in the prototype.

  /*
  Exercise 4:
  Write code that will create person, student, and professor objects.
  • Person objects have
  o name and age fields
  o a greeting method that prints out: “Greetings, my name is [name] and I am
  [age] years old.”
  o a salute method that prints out: “Good morning!, and in case I dont see you,
  good afternoon, good evening and good night!”
  Student objects inherit name, age, and salute from person. They also have a field
  ‘major’ and have their own greeting method. Their greeting is “Hey, my name is
  [name] and I am studying [major]. The greeting should be output to the console.
  • Professor objects inherit name, age, and salute from person. They also have a field
  ‘department’ and have their own greeting method. Their salutation is “Good day,
  my name is [name] and I am in the [department] department.” Output it to the
  console.
  • Create a professor object and a student object. Call both the greeting and salutation
  methods on each.
  • Do this exercise once using the object prototype approach for inheritance and then
  using the function constructor approach.
